Ignews is a blog, that uses powerful technologies as a Next.js, SCSS, Stripe, and more, on this application I could learn loat of technologies, and apply to a project

# üñ•Ô∏è  Technologies used

* NextJS
* SCSS (To style my components)
* Stripe (To handle the payments)
* FaunaDB (Serveless Database)
* NextAuth (To handle the login with GitHub OAuth)
* Prismic CMS

# üöÄ Overview of the project

How works?

The application is a blog, where the user needs to subscribe to get access to the posts. To handle payment I use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/br), after the user subscribe I save the data of the user as (name, email, subscribe status).

One of the features is if the user dont have the access he can see a preview
